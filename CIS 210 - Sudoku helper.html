  <h1>Sudoku Helper</h1>
<p>This assignment is due at 5pm on Friday, November 18.  Use
  Canvas to turn sdktactics.py in electronically.</p>
<h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>This is practice in object-oriented programming,
  particularly illustrating how the same object can "belong to" (be
  referenced from) different containers.  It provides a little
  more practice indexing lists as arrays (which you'll need to
  finish the "groups" list) and using boolean values in variables. 
  </p>
  <p>
  This program also continues our trend toward programs with more
  moving parts.  You can't keep this whole program in your head.
  You will read more code than you will write. As a consequence,
  a big part of the work is reading what you need, organizing the
  knowledge, and keeping just the <em>right</em> details in your
  head to make the changes you need to make.
  </p>
  <p>
  This program also 
  illustrates callback functions (listeners) for the "model view
  controller" (MVC) architectural design pattern (covered in lecture
  on Monday), to cleanly factor
  a view component
  (sdkdisplay.py and the graphics modules it uses) from the logic
  of a model component (sdkboard.py, which can be used with or without
  the graphical display). Listeners are also used to signal progress
  when filling in open spaces in a Sudoku puzzle.  I have provided
  this code for you, but you should read it and try to understand
  how it works. 
  </p>
<h1>Pair Assignment</h1>
  <p>I encourage you to use <em>pair programming</em> to
  complete this assignment. Work together with one classmate.
  (Switch up; Don't forget the maximum of 3 projects with the same
  partner.) 
  </p>
  <p>Before writing code at the computer, you should work together and
  independently on the design.  Each of you should be able to clearly
  explain how the program or a part of the program will work.  
  When you are convinced that you both understand how the code will
  work, then and only then are you ready to write the code.
</p>

<div class="item">
<h1>Sudoku helper</h1>
  <p>Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement puzzle.For an
  example and a bit of history, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">this wikipedia article on
  Sudoku</a>.  One of the interesting bits of history is the role of
  of a Sudoku puzzle generating program in popularizing Sudoku.
  Creating good puzzles is much harder than solving them! 
 </p>
 <p>Your program will read a Sudoku board that may be partially
  completed.  A board file contains 9 lines of 9 symbols, each of
  which is either a digit 0-9 or the 
  full-stop symbol ‘.’ (also called “period”
  or “dot”)
  to indicate a tile that has not been filled. Your program will first
  check for violations of Sudoku rules.  If the board is valid, 
  then your program will apply two 
  simple tactics to fill in an as many open tiles as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>A valid Sudoku solution has the following properties: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In each of the 9 rows, each digit 1..9 appears
    exactly once.  (No duplicates, and no missing digits.)
    </li>
    <li>In each of the 9 columns, each digit 1..9 appears
    exactly once.
    </li>
    <li>The board can be divided into 9 subregion blocks, each 3x3.
    In each of these blocks, each digit 1..9 appears
    exactly once.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When a board contains the full-stop symbol ".", we check for
  duplicates but not for missing digits.
  </p>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>Your program will read a file in which each line
  contains a sequence of digits and '.' characters.  The
  file name is given on the command line, like this:<br>
  <kbd>python3 sudoko.py myboard.txt</kbd></p>
  <p>It may be useful (though slower) to see a graphical depiction of
  the board, with bad (duplicated) tiles highlighted. You can give the
  command like this:<br>
  <kbd>python3 sudoku.py --display myboard.txt</kbd>
  </p><p>Input board descriptions look like this:</p>
  <code><pre>...26.7.1
68..7..9.
19...45..
82.1...4.
..46.29..
.5...3.28
..93...74
.4..5..36
7.3.18...
</pre></code>
  <p>If there are no duplicated entries in the board (and regardless
  of whether it is complete, with digits only, or has '.'
  characters indicating tiles yet to be filled), your program will
  proceed to the next step.  If there are duplicated elements,
  your program will report them. 
  For example, suppose the input board contained this:
  </p>
  <code><pre>435269781
682571493
197834562
826195347
374682915
951743628
519326874
248957136
963418257
</pre></code>
  <p>Then the interaction would look like this:</p>
  <code><pre>$ python3 sudoku.py board1.txt
*** Tile at  5 0  is a duplicate of  9
*** Tile at  8 0  is a duplicate of  9
*** Tile at  3 8  is a duplicate of  7
*** Tile at  8 8  is a duplicate of  7
*** Tile at  6 2  is a duplicate of  9
*** Tile at  6 7  is a duplicate of  7
Sudoku FAIL
</pre></code>
<p>Note that when a duplicate is found, we report <em>all</em> instances of the duplicate. 
For example, both 9's in the first column are reported as duplicates. </p>
<p>If you used the display option like this: </p>
  <code><pre>$ python3 sudoku.py --display ../board1.txt
  </pre></code>
  <p>Then instead of the textual output, the program will display the board with duplicate items
  marked:</p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Sudoku helper_files/Sudoku-display.png">
  
  <h2>How to check</h2>
   <p>Because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">pigeonhole
  principle</a> of mathematics, if the board contains only the 
  digits 1..9, the following two statements are
  equivalent: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>None of the 9 digits 1..9 appears more than once in a
  row. </li>
  <li>Each of the 9 digits 1..9 appear at least once in a row.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That is why we are only checking for duplicates.  Checking for
  missing entries is similar but slightly more complicated,
   particularly since we are allowing "open" tiles with the dot
   (".") symbol.
  </p>
  <p>Python makes it fairly easy to check for duplicates, using the
   built-in “set” data type, although the logic will require 
   careful design and coding. 
   
   See the lecture from Friday November 13 for
   the basic idea. The other challenge for you in checking a board
  for validity is to finish filling in the 
   lists of all the groups (blocks, rows, and columns). 
 </p>
  <p>If the board is valid, then (and only then) your program
  will apply two simple tactics to fill some of the empty tiles,
  then print the resulting board.  (Note that this has no effect
  on a board that is already complete.)  For example: 
  </p>
    <code><pre>$ more board-sandiway-intermediate.txt 
.2.6.8...
58...97..
....4....
37....5..
6.......4
..8....13
....2....
..98...36
...3.6.9.
$ python3 sudoku.py board-sandiway-intermediate.txt 
.2.6.8...
58...97..
....4....
37....5..
6......74
..8....13
...92....
..98...36
...3.6.9.
</pre></code>
<p>In the example above, only a few tiles have been filled in,
  because only simple tactics have been used.  If you use the
   --display option, you can see progress in filling in tiles,
  including elimination of some candidates:
</p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Sudoku helper_files/Sudoku-partial.png">
<p>

  For some easy
  problems, the simple tactics may be enough:
</p>
<code><pre>$ more board-incomplete-easy1.txt
...26.7.1
68..7..9.
19...45..
82.1...4.
..46.29..
.5...3.28
..93...74
.4..5..36
7.3.18...
$ python3 sudoku.py board-incomplete-easy1.txt 
435269781
682571493
197834562
826195347
374682915
951743628
519326874
248957136
763418259
</pre></code>

  <h1>What you must solve</h1>
  
  <p>We will consider the solving part of your program correct
  if it can solve all Sudoku
  puzzles that can be solved using only the “<a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/nakedsingle.htm">naked
  single</a>” (also called “singleton” or
  “sole candidate”) and “<a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/hiddensingle.htm">hidden
  single</a>” (also called “unique candidate”)
  tactics described at <a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/solvingtechniques.htm">the
  SadMan Software site</a>. </p>

<h1>Notes and hints on the Sudoku helper</h1>
<p>It is difficult to avoid using the numbers 3 and 9 as magic numbers
  in a Sudoku program, and it is probably not worth trying. Since they
  have no other meaning aside from the size of the board and blocks
  within the board, using symbolic constants doesn't help.
  </p>
  <p>
  This code features something you may not have seen before:
  Functions as objects. Look at the way a Tile object allows functions
  to be registered as event handlers, and how that is used so that the
  display of an sdkboard.Tile object can be highlighted even though
  the sdkboard module contains no references to the sdkdisplay module
  at all.  (The text reporting of duplicates is handled the same way, 
  for consistency and to make it easy to suppress the text output when 
  the graphical display is used.) 
  This is a slightly simplified version of an important
  design pattern that you will see and use a lot in the future.  It's
  called "model-view-controller" because it distinguishes a "model"
  object (the sdkboard.Board and its component Tile objects) from a
  a "view" object (the display managed by sdkdisplay, or the textual "display"
  of messages).  If we were
  taking interactive input from a mouse, that would be the
  "controller" functionality of the "model-view-controller" pattern.
  We'll talk about this in lecture. 
  </p>
  <h2>Starter code and boards to test with</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of moving parts!  However, it is organized so
  that you never have to think about many parts at once:</p>
  <img src="./CIS 210 - Sudoku helper_files/Sudoku-depends.png">
  <p>
  You only
  need to change one file (sdktactics.py), but you will need to
  read and understand at least one more (sdkboard.py) and probably
  also the main program (sudoku.py, which does very little itself). 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/sdktactics.py">sdktactics.py</a>
    This is where you need to provide logic for checking validity,
    and also for the naked single and hidden single solving tactics.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/sdkboard.py">sdkboard.py</a>
    The Tile and Board classes.  While you won't need to change
    these, you will need to read them carefully and refer to them
    while writing your tactics module.
    </li>
  <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/sudoku.py">sudoku.py</a>
    Main program ... it just reads the command line and
    wires together the parts.  This includes choosing either
    the graphical or textual display.
    </li>
  <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/sdkdisplay.py">sdkdisplay.py</a>  
     Uses the grid module to display a Sudoku board.  Note the way
     it registers listeners to highlight duplicate items,
    display newly selected values in tiles, and display choices
    for tiles that haven't been filled in yet.</li>
  <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/sdktextview.py">sdktextview.py</a>
     Default textual output, which registers listeners just like 
     the graphical display.  Note how the main program wires up 
     either the graphical display or this text display.  It could just
     as easily wire up both.</li>
  <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/boards.zip">boards.zip</a>
  Bad boards that you should recognize as invalid, easy (and valid)
  boards that you can solve with naked single and hidden single,
  and hard boards that you will not be able to fully solve with
  those tactics. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/grid.py">grid.py</a>
  A support module that provides a display for grids, using graphics.py.
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/sudoku/graphics.py">graphics.py</a>
  An open source graphics module providing simple graphics from Python.
  Not to be confused with turtle graphics!
